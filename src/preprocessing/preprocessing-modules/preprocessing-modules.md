# Preprocessing modules

These modules are responsible for processing and validating the AMP code before
it's displayed inside the viewer.

## Validator module

This module runs the [AMP validator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/amphtml-validator)
on the AMP code to ensure it's compliant with the requirements for the
`AMP4EMAIL` format.

It doesn't modify the AMP code and throws an exception when the AMP is invalid.
